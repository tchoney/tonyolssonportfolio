# Designing what is good

Tetra Pak is one of the world's largest manufacturers of processing and packaging solutions for food. I was a part of a pilot project working with data analytics and visualisation primarily towards internal stakeholders in Predictive Maintenance and Condition Monitoring. 
The group are tasked with real-time monitoring of critical equipment parts. Predictive Maintenance identifies deviations in machine functions that could lead to performance issues or machine breakdowns. 
They offer Predictive Maintenance service taking full responsibility for equipment set-up, data analysis and maintenance.

The project started with a design sprint according to the google venture model where we acted as full members and prototyper where the goal was to identify primary and secondary needs and presenting a visual proposal on data visualization accordingly. 

After the sprint, we were invited back to the project for UX research and Ui design. Following the scrum model, we acted as full members of the development team as well as researchers to provide insights for product and business owners. The research included internal needs mapping beyond the initial scope as well as testing design iterations with internal stakeholders. This work also included the development of visual guidelines for interactive report building within the Power Bi framework. We were also tasked with design implementation and report building including database relationship management and customization of interactive reports towards secondary stakeholders which include business owners and external clients.  

After a successful pilot project, we were invited into a new project with the same focus where we continue working with the original group acting as knowledge transfers between the original project and the new initiative. At this point, the overall initiative scaled up to SAFE 3.0 including a task force of 60+ personnel involved in the initiative where we acted as the Leax Ux unit providing insights and UX support.

I was a part of two successful projects where we were able to establish and maintain a user-centred approach to the visualization of data aimed to contribute to existing workflows.  We were also able to provide a model for how to customize the interactive reports to provide key insights for multiple stakeholders internally and externally.      
Even though the project where successful we found that a stronger design thinking approach with an alternate service design strategy early on in the initiation of the project could have been beneficial. Many stakeholders needs had been assumed and not matched with real-life needs. As the established workflow proved there is a high level of flexibility and customizability possible in the current state of interactive report building technology. This offers the possibility to guide design strategy from the start towards a customized solution according to specific needs and users rather than looking for unified solutions that fit many needs.
