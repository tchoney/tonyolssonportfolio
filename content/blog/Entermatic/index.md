# Door affordance 

Entermatic is a global brand within the intelligent door opening solution.  was hired to design a user-friendly mobile app for controlling door solutions in their retail segment. Entermatic lack any formal brand guidelines where I also worked on building this for digital product development. I worked as the sole designer on the development, working from the very start with setting up the design strategy and user flows to the production design during development. 
This was Entermatics first publication of a digital product where I also consulted on the communication and setup for digital distribution through the Google and Apple stores.
