# Promoting digital design 
Through my work with the 1scale1 design studio, I co-founded and through my work with the university I have collaborated with the City of Malmö on multiple initiatives mainly focusing on educating and promoting design and technology amongst children and youth in the region. This work has produced multiple workshops for the public, specially design classes for high school and the creation of Sweden's first hackerspace. 
Fabriken is a part of Stapelbäddsparken which is a cultural centre place in the west harbour in Malmö. 1scale1 was one of the first partners where we helped build the foundation for the cultural centre also set up the strategy for the Fabriken and pave the way for how to operate it.
