# The digital journey 

Kh채rs is a premium flooring solution company based in the Nordics. I was invited to help Kh채rs set up a strategy and roadmap for their entier digitalization process. I developed a framework dubbed "Lighthouse" to help them evaluate and build business cases for all ongoing digital initiatives and to define a starting point. I also worked on work method strategies in the digitalization of the company and how to move into agile workflows while building up internal digital competencies gradually. 

For Kh채rs I have also worked on digital innovation initiatives building a new online floor planning solution with a strategy on how to better integrate and set requirements for their 3ed party solutions providers.
