## Design Prototyping 

I worked together with the Arduino foundation since their early start in 2006. Mainly in the production of learning content alongside hardware testing. Much of our work together was based on experimental learning technics building on productive failure learning models. 
Much of the work consisted of written work but I also produced a multiple video tutorials, some in collaborations with other companies. 
I also got the chance to produce a few "commercial" for some of their new product launches.

On multiple occasions, I have acted as a spokesperson for the Arduino prototyping platform performing guest lectures and workshops around the world.
